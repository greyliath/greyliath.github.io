<p>Our mind is a constant source of new ideas and thoughts, which often end up garbled after we move on with time, and new
ideas and thoughts supersede these pieces of brilliance we once had.
Bookkeeping is essential to record one’s state of mind, and for retrospection. I remember the times when my mind was
bustling with fantastic theories, that I couldn’t keep track of them after a while. Most of them have become obscure with time;
I have forgotten all the specifics and the minute details. That is when I started blogging, to try and keep track of them
as well as to share these with people who might be fascinated by the same things as I am, which has also introduced me to
some amazing people.</p>
