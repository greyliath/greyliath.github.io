<p>“We’re trying to shoot them down?” Su asked.
<br />“That does nothing” the General scoffed.
He continued, “We need to blow ‘em up. That’s our only shot.”<br />
“And how do we do that” Su was thinking out loud.
<br />“Bait and switch. We fill up the bunkers with their “fix”.”
<br />“Coke? The F2 variant?” Su knew the plan.
<br />“What else? Anyway, they go in, we close the doors, we blow ‘em up. Easy. Watch.”
<br />Hordes of the infected charge into the bunker, grinning and howling. Not long before the entire bunker blows up.
<br />“Alright, I’ve gotta do the same at camp Zero. Remember the training.” the General got on his chopper and it took off.
<br />The pilot smirked at Su in a weird way before he got on the chopper.
<br />“WAIT! THE PILOT’S INFECTED! HE’S GONNA KILL THE GENERAL!” Su shouted at the top of his voice, picked up an Rpg and shot the chopper down.
<br />The General magically appeared beside him, and said “You stupid son of a”
<br />“Nap time’s over. Wake up buddy” Bar said.
<br />Su had been dreaming again. Dreaming of his training. Yet another dream horribly gone wrong ever since he aced the training.
<br />“Hey. Wake up. We’re almost there.” Chan was waking up Nith.<br /><br /></p>
<h1 id="the-mission">The mission</h1>
<p>Su, Bar, Chan and Nith were on a weapons salvage mission. The simplest one, albeit a tricky one, since they were embarking when
daylight was almost over. They were at their old dorm, to pick up a crate containing explosives. They didn’t have time during the
‘evacuation’, fighting off their friends who had just gotten infected. The whole dorm was a mess when they left, body parts flailing and blood squirting out of the bites their beloved friends left. They had no choice but to leave the weapons and all other supplies behind. Just send another crew on an errand mission to get it for them, right? Ironically, the command chose them to clean up their own mess.
<br />“Quick getaway, alright? No messing around. Just waltz in there, collect the crate, sprint your ass back here. We’ll be out of here in a minute.” Bar was the driver, and in charge of the mission.
<br />“Yea, mission detail was very clear. Pick up the crate, shake hands with our pals waiting for us, deliver their ‘present’ to you” Nith retorted. “I don’t like this place one bit.”
<br />“Neither do we. Just make it quick.” Chan was the peace keeper of the crew.
<br />Su and Nith reached the room that contained the explosives and began sifting through the mess to find usable ammunition. And there he was, Sam, sitting on his couch, right in front of Su, smoking one of the last cigars, grinning.<br />
<br />“Whoa, whoa, who do we have here? Hey Sam, how’s it going?” Su remarked in surprise.
<br />Sam, whose only last shred of consciousness was aiming at Su’s neck charged towards him in
excitement.
<br />“Whoa, hold your horses boy. Down. Down.” Su quietly said.</p>
