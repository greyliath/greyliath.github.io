&lt;p&gt;Primogen is a term used to describe Camarilla officials that, at least in theory, serve as the representatives of their respective clans to the prince of a city ruled by the sect. The term is both singular and plural, and refers to both individual representatives and to the Primogen council as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many Camarilla offices, the Primogeniture predates the very existence of the sect, and was pretty common during the Dark Ages. Theoretically, a primogen is the oldest vampire of his clan, and serves as a representative and voice for the clan in city affairs. In general, the ruling vampires of the city value the Primogens and their opinions. They are called in to consult on decisions, and their recommendations carry great weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the modern era, the officeholder is usually decided within the clan proper by voting, violence, or someone higher up giving the orders, rather than simply comparing ages. Primogen traditionally make up a council that is the second most powerful institution in the city after the Princedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dublin, each Primogen is expected to manage the affairs of their clan. Generally, the Prince offers her seal of approval provided paperwork is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

Dublin, as it stands, is a unique city with variances in the clans that some might not expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clans in Dublin that are friendly to the Camarilla will be covered first, followed by independents. Several clans are considered openly hositle, and will be noted as such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;What is a Clan?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clan is a term used by vampires to describe the major groups of Cainites who share common characteristics passed on by the blood. There are 13 known clans, each of which was reputedly founded by an Antediluvian, a member of the Third Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Camarilla of Dublin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;&quot;Camarilla - a word that denoted both that it was a convocation of peers or comrades and that it met in session secret from mortal knowledge.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are considered to be Camarilla clans in these nights. The majority of these clans have presence in Dublin with Camarilla membership, though Anarchs may exist in their ranks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Brujah&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brujah have a reputation as fierce warriors; their affinity for war is carried in their blood. Because their weakness is their rage, they are much more vulnerable to frenzy. Quick to anger and always passionate, they have been steadily regaining their position as a clan of lofty philosophers and activists, and are known for mysterious knowledge and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a clan, the Brujah have next to no organization. Outside of the clan, the Brujah adore building structures, and then other Brujah adore tearing them down. Among modern Brujah, the primary structure is the division between the Iconoclast and Idealist factions of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brujah are infamous for ignoring the Traditions of the Embrace, and consequently Embrace whomever they feel like, whenever they feel like. Brujah are stereotypically the source for most Caitiff, because they are presumed to neglect training their childer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Gangrel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gangrel, like the Brujah, are among the best vampire fighters. Unlike the Brujah, their ferocity stems from their animalistic instinct and rage, rather than anarchic anger. Gangrel are loners and prefer solitude; they're also the closest to nature and the beast than all the other vampire clans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gangrel are considered the most feral and predatory of the Kindred, and because of their reclusive natures, animalistic tendencies and loose organization, are the least social of the Cainites, preferring solitude to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also tend to be extremely territorial and possessive; to enter a Gangrel's territory without permission is certain death. They do have their role and reputation among the Kindred as fierce warriors, but to get a Gangrel to agree to work with others, even other Gangrel, can be a difficult, if not impossible, task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lasombra&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proud nobles who command the very essence of darkness and shadow — to the point of worshipping it, some say. Since their beginning, the Clan has extremely strong ties to the sea; some speculate that this fascination stems from the Antediluvian's experience of the Deluge and marks his beginning of fascination with the Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distaste for the rabble the Sabbat is encased in shows clearly in the attitudes of the Camarilla Lasombra, as they regard the Sabbat tactic of mass Embraces as wasteful and insulting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasombra pride themselves on doing things with style and elegance. That does not mean they all dress alike, act alike or furnish their havens the same way. Almost anything can be elegant. One of the classic Lasombra virtues is the gift of exposition, allowing one vampire to explain to others why this particular choice is in fact elegant. The clan favors its members who can articulate their preferences in persuasive manner. The clan frowns on efforts to shock – unless they work. Managing to introduce something so unfamiliar that it tramples on existing assumptions and yet, with explanation, manages to fit clan imperatives is one way to win a great deal of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the Lasombra and Ventrue &lt;i&gt;despise&lt;/i&gt; each other, and Ventrue generally are not happy to see them in the Camarilla in Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Malkavian&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malkavians carry the curse of madness, each childe gaining a degree of insanity after their Embrace. Historically they've been Kindred's seers and oracles, bound by strange insight and compulsions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their minds allow them to see things other Kindred cannot, a trait often referred to as the 'Gift of Insight'. A Malkavian's level of madness varies; no two Kindred of the clan seem to be the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Malkavians of Dublin are particularly valued - the prominent ones have created wonderful names for themselves in Camarilla society, moving the understanding and acceptance of mental health forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their blood can also pass this madness onto their Ghouls, twisting their mind and personality from the moment they ingest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nosferatu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damnedest of the damned, the Nosferatu are disfigured and have a frightening appearance. This means that they can only use sewers, and should they be seen by humans, they will violate the Masquerade. Due to this however, the Nosferatu have become very gifted at sneaking and hacking, which means they have information on almost everything and everyone. They gather information not only as a means of survival, but out of pure pleasure as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nosferatu are ostracized by other vampires due to their appearance, but also their ability to dig up dirt on everyone. This doesn't stop the leaders of other vampire clans to come to them when they need information, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nosferatu skills as Hackers and information brokers make them known as the eyes and the ears of the Camarilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Toreador&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clan has long been associated with art and socializing, which is incorporated into their weakness – when they are faced with a thing of beauty, they struggle to turn their attention from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other vampires can travel through human society, and even blend in, the Toreador do it flawlessly and effortlessly. They are the closest to humans in appearance; they enjoy being in the center of the spotlight, and having mortals admire them. They're also the best manipulators and can easily get kine to do what they want. The Toreador are creatures of beauty and passion, and most of them were musicians, artists and poets in their mortal lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tremere&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tremere are a clan of mages, spellcasters, and warlocks, who use magic they learned while living in undeath. They are considered to be back-stabbers by other vampire clans. The Tremere as a clan are insular and secretive. While they are hated by many, this hate has not exceeded their usefulness. They have helped the Camarilla on many occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tremere are the creators and practitioners of a type of blood magic called Thaumaturgy. Not considered very reliable by the other clans, the Tremere are shrouded in mystery and keep their intentions well-hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power structure of the entire Tremere clan was originally a very rigid hierarchy held together by a mass Blood Bond, known as the Pyramid, with the founder Tremere himself at the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other clans, the Tremere are very selective of who they Embrace; there are strict traditions and laws concerning an Embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ventrue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling class, the nobility, aristocracy, company CEOs, wealthy individuals, politicians – it's these people that make up the Ventrue clan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They move in the same high circles as the Toreador, but unlike the Toreador, Ventrue love to be in charge and they take on the burden of leadership stoically. The Camarilla as well as the Ventrue clan are hated with a passion by the Brujah and Gangrel clans, due to Ventrue desire to rule over all Kindred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Giovanni&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An independent, insular, extended family of vampires who practice the art of commanding the dead while commanding global finances. The Giovanni of Dublin head off the funeral homes and chippers of the city -  they promise these two families don't overlap skillsets as much as one might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clan Giovanni is both a clan and a family. They Embrace exclusively within their family and are heavily focused on the goals of money and necromantic power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like everything else in the family, the Embrace is a reward. Promotion for good service, and more than other clans, the Giovanni actively consider factors like generation in the Embrace. Being Embraced by a lower-generation clan member is considered a performance bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are known for an incredibly painful bite as their Clan curse, making the Masquerade more difficult for members of this clan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;True Independents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Ravnos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomads and tricksters who can force the mind to see what isn’t there, though they are slaves to the vices they indulge in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now cursed to wander without being able to settle roots like others, those who managed to survive the fateful encounter with their Antediluvian just a few decades ago now (or managed to avoid his call altogether) have with their childer started a revival of the Clan by taking to their nomadic roots in earnest, using their experience to stay ahead of the new threats to Kindred existence. Some fight the curse by setting up multiple havens and using different masks in a single domain, but it is difficult work to maintain for long before something goes wrong for them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Sabbat or Openly Hostile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tzimisce&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eldritch Old World lords who have little in common with the mortal world and can manipulate flesh and bone at a whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one were to described a Tzimisce as inhuman and sadistic, it would probably commend them for their perspicacity, and then demonstrate that their mortal definition of sadism was laughably inadequate. The Tzimisce have left the human condition behind gladly, and now focus on transcending the limitations of the vampiric state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tzimisce are extremely adept at using torture, being immensely creative when it comes to inflict grievous wounds and exaggerate harm upon someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another torture is their famous blood bond torture, when they blood bond one person to another and then kill one of them in order to see the other one suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Followers of Set&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A religious movement that evangelizes the example of a chthonic god, while seeking out the world’s secret places and protecting ancient artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orthodox Setite belief dictates that Set will one day return to rule or consume the world, and devout Setites prepare the way for his resurrection. To this end, the clan remains independent of the Sects of other Kindred, and practice with great skill the arts of corruption, deceit and ancient sorcery. They refer to themselves as the Mesu Bedshet, the &quot;Children of Rebellion&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>C0RV1$</name></author><summary type="html">This aims to be an unbiased view of the clans, in all of their various glories.
